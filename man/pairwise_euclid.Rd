\title{Pairwise Euclidean distances between two sets of points in a euclidean space}
\usage{
pairwise_euclid(x, y, na_rm = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector or a numeric matrix or a data frame. Rows are points.
If a vector is supplied it is treated as a column matrix of dimension 1.
Justification for naming: Named \code{x} to follow standard math notation}

\item{y}{A numeric vector or a numeric matrix or a data frame. Same previous rules apply as \code{x}
Justification for naming: Named \code{y} to follow standard math notation}

\item{na_rm}{Logical. If TRUE drop any rows in \code{x} or \code{y} that contain NA or non finite values
before computing distances. If FALSE such values cause an error. Default TRUE.
Named \code{na_rm} to reflect the common base R notation}
}
\value{
Numeric matrix of size n by m, where n is the number of kept rows in \code{x}
and m is the number of kept rows in \code{y}.
}
\description{
Function calculates a matrix of pairwise Euclidean distances between two inputs. Each input can be
a numeric vector, treated as one dimensional points, or a numeric matrix or data frame
with rows as points and columns as features or dimensions. The number of columns (dimensions) must MATCH!!
}
\details{
Internally this function uses the identity: ||x - y||^2 = ||x||^2 + ||y||^2 - 2 x.y for efficiency.
}
\examples{
# vectors as one dimensional points
pairwise_euclid(c(0,1,3), c(2,5))

# with NA rows dropped
X <- rbind(c(0,0), c(NA, 1), c(2,0))
Y <- rbind(c(0,1), c(2,2))
pairwise_euclid(X, Y, na_rm = TRUE)

# Example 2: two dimensional points stored in matrices
X <- rbind(c(0, 0), c(1, 1), c(2, 0))
Y <- rbind(c(0, 1), c(2, 2))
pairwise_euclid(X, Y)
}
